# exibris-primo

This repo maintains the code which is uploaded to the exlibris servers for Primo customisation - there is no build server.

It is a fork of an older repo, uqlibrary-reusable-components, maintaining only the primo elements.

### Getting Started

Project requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- NPM, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.

The [primo readme](src/readme.md) has more details.
